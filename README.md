# Task 4: Simple Statistical Classifier for Iris

## Overview

This task involves building a simple statistical classifier in Python to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its features. The process is divided into two main steps:

1.  **Threshold-based Classifier (Pseudo Code):** Based on the investigation outputs from Task 3, create pseudo code for a classifier that uses thresholds on the Iris flower features (e.g., sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) to predict its species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

2.  **Python Application (Iris\_Species.py):** Implement the pseudo code in a Python application named `Iris_Species.py`. This application will take a set of Iris flower features as input and output the predicted species. The application will then be tested against the iris dataset to determine its classification accuracy (expressed as the percentage of correctly classified instances).
